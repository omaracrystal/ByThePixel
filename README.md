# Crazy Cat Lady

## By the Pixel Challenge

### Task:

Build a fully responsive login page from the provided design file for a new “Crazy Cat Lady" web application.

### How:

	• Create a codepen at https://codepen.io/pen/. You can build this locally, but if you do, please transfer everything to the Codepen you create.

### What you’ll need: ASSETS (these are hosted on S3 and can be used in HTML and CSS)

	• Cats background: https://s3.amazonaws.com/btp-front-end-testing/cats.jpg
	• Lock icon: https://s3.amazonaws.com/btp-front-end-testing/lock-icon.png
	• Person icon: https://s3.amazonaws.com/btp-front-end-testing/person-Icon.png
	• Logo: https://s3.amazonaws.com/btp-front-end-testing/logo.png

### Design Mock-ups:

	• Photoshop: https://s3.amazonaws.com/btp-front-end-testing/Front-end-developer.psd
	• PNG: https://s3.amazonaws.com/btp-front-end-testing/Front-end-developer.png

### Direction:

	• No need to wire the form into anything functional. Just slice and dice.
	• Do not use any frameworks, etc. like bootstrap. We want to see how you build this completely custom.
	• Do your best! We’re looking for accuracy to the design, ability to make good decisions with HTML and CSS and your ‘responsive' decision making.
	• Please also let us know how long this took you to complete.
